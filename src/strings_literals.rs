// Introduction to string literals.
// To run the code, type "cargo run literals" in the termnial.

/*
String literals in Rust are a convenient way to include static strings directly in your code.
They are immutable and stored in the program's binary, making them fast and efficient.
However, understanding their nuances, such as their type, lifetime, and how they differ from String objects, is crucial.
Let's explore string literals through examples, highlighting their characteristics and usage in Rust.
